    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Banana Cue is a beloved Filipino street food made by frying ripe saba bananas and coating them in a rich, caramelized brown sugar glaze. Known for its deep sweetness and satisfying texture, Banana Cue is a quick and popular snack enjoyed by people of all ages in the Philippines. Each bite is filled with the natural sweetness of the banana, enhanced by the crispy, sugary coating that forms during cooking.
        <br><br>
        Typically served on skewers, Banana Cue is convenient for on-the-go snacking and is widely sold by street vendors. Its caramelized exterior provides a slightly crunchy texture, which contrasts perfectly with the soft, creamy inside of the banana. This treat, much like turon, highlights the simple yet delicious ingredients available locally, and itâ€™s a great representation of Filipino comfort food.
