    <h1>TURON</h1>
    <img src="../img/turon.jpg">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Turon is a popular Filipino snack made from thin slices of ripe saba bananas and sometimes jackfruit, all wrapped in a spring roll wrapper, then fried to a crisp golden-brown. This snackâ€™s irresistible crunch is complemented by a sweet, caramelized sugar coating that forms as it cooks. The bananas become tender and creamy on the inside, while the outside remains crispy, creating a delightful contrast in textures with each bite. Often sold by street vendors or prepared at home, turon is a go-to treat that combines simplicity with rich, comforting flavors.

        A staple in Filipino cuisine, turon is loved for its versatility and ease of preparation. In addition to traditional ingredients, some people add creative fillings like mangoes, sweet potatoes, or even grated coconut for extra flavor and texture. Whether enjoyed as an afternoon snack, a dessert, or a treat with coffee or tea, turon holds a nostalgic appeal for many Filipinos. Its sweet, tropical taste reflects the vibrant flavors of the Philippines and embodies the warmth of Filipino hospitality and love for homemade, shared meals.
